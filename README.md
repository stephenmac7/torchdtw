# PyTorch DTW C++ extension

Dynamic time warping in native PyTorch, with CPU and CUDA backends.

```bash
pip install torchdtw
```

This package requires PyTorch 2.10 or later. It is developed using the PyTorch
2.10 Stable ABI, and compiled with instructions for CUDA cards from Volta to Blackwell.
It is available on Linux (with CUDA support), macOS, and Windows (without CUDA).
This was originally made for [fastabx](https://github.com/bootphon/fastabx), but
it can be used in other projects. Only the exact DTW is implemented, there is
no plan to add variants.

## Usage

This package provides four functions:

### `dtw`

```python
dtw(distances, *, step_pattern='symmetric1')
```

Compute the DTW cost of the given ``distances`` 2D tensor.

Use ``+inf`` to mask forbidden alignments. NaN distances are unsupported: the result is
unspecified and may differ between the CPU and CUDA backends. Integer ``distances`` accumulate
the cost in their own dtype and may overflow on long sequences; use a wide enough integer dtype
or a floating dtype.

**Parameters:**

- **distances** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 2D tensor of shape (n, m) representing the pairwise distances between two sequences.
- **step_pattern** (<code>str</code>) – Step pattern, as in dtw-python: ``"symmetric1"`` normalizes the accumulated cost by the
path length, ``"symmetric2"`` counts diagonal steps twice and normalizes by ``n + m``.

**Returns:**

- <code>Tensor</code> – A scalar tensor with the cost.

### `dtw_batch`

```python
dtw_batch(distances, sx, sy, *, symmetric, step_pattern='symmetric1')
```

Compute the batched DTW cost on the ``distances`` 4D tensor.

Only the ``(sx[i], sy[j])`` sub-block of each pair is read, so padding beyond the sequence
lengths is ignored. Every ``sx[i]`` must be ``<= s1`` and every ``sy[j] <= s2``: the CPU backend
validates this, but the CUDA backend assumes it and reads out of bounds if violated. Use ``+inf``
to mask forbidden alignments. NaN distances are unsupported: the result is unspecified and may
differ between the CPU and CUDA backends. Integer ``distances`` accumulate the cost in their own
dtype and may overflow on long sequences; use a wide enough integer dtype or a floating dtype.

**Parameters:**

- **distances** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 4D tensor of shape (n1, n2, s1, s2) representing the pairwise distances between two
batches of sequences.
- **sx** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 1D tensor of shape (n1,) representing the lengths of the sequences in the first batch.
- **sy** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 1D tensor of shape (n2,) representing the lengths of the sequences in the second batch.
- **symmetric** (<code>bool</code>) – Whether or not the DTW is symmetric (i.e., the two batches are the same).
- **step_pattern** (<code>str</code>) – Step pattern, as in dtw-python: ``"symmetric1"`` normalizes the accumulated cost by the
path length, ``"symmetric2"`` counts diagonal steps twice and normalizes by ``n + m``.

**Returns:**

- <code>Tensor</code> – A 2D tensor of shape (n1, n2) with the costs.

### `dtw_cost_and_path`

```python
dtw_cost_and_path(distances, *, step_pattern='symmetric1')
```

Compute the DTW cost and path of the given ``distances`` 2D tensor in a single pass.

Equivalent to calling :func:`dtw` and :func:`dtw_path`, but fills the cost matrix only once.
Use ``+inf`` to mask forbidden alignments. NaN distances are unsupported.

**Parameters:**

- **distances** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 2D tensor of shape (n, m) representing the pairwise distances between two sequences.
- **step_pattern** (<code>str</code>) – Step pattern, as in dtw-python: ``"symmetric1"`` normalizes the accumulated cost by the
path length, ``"symmetric2"`` counts diagonal steps twice and normalizes by ``n + m``.

**Returns:**

- <code>tuple[Tensor, Tensor]</code> – A tuple ``(cost, path)`` with a scalar tensor and a 2D tensor of shape (*, 2) with the path indices.

### `dtw_path`

```python
dtw_path(distances, *, step_pattern='symmetric1')
```

Compute the DTW path of the given ``distances`` 2D tensor.

No batched implementation is provided for now.
Use ``+inf`` to mask forbidden alignments. NaN distances are unsupported and give an
unspecified path.

**Parameters:**

- **distances** (<code>Tensor</code>) – A 2D tensor of shape (n, m) representing the pairwise distances between two sequences.
- **step_pattern** (<code>str</code>) – Step pattern, as in dtw-python: ``"symmetric1"`` normalizes the accumulated cost by the
path length, ``"symmetric2"`` counts diagonal steps twice and normalizes by ``n + m``.

**Returns:**

- <code>Tensor</code> – A 2D tensor of shape (*, 2) with the path indices.

## Performance

For many DTWs on short sequences, prefer `dtw_batch` over a Python loop of `dtw` calls.
A single `dtw_batch` launches one CUDA kernel (one block per pair) or one parallel CPU
loop, amortizing dispatch, allocation, and launch overhead across the whole batch.
